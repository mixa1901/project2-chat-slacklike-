# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

An online messaging service using Flask, similar in spirit to Slack. Users are able to sign into your site with a display name, create channels (i.e. chatrooms) to communicate in, as well as see and join existing channels. Once a channel is selected, users are able to send and receive messages with one another in real time. And users are able to delete their own messages.
